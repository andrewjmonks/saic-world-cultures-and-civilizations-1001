	* definition 2
		* a figure that is "composed" of contradictory elements, such as animal and human parts that could never occur in nature

## MAINLAND GREECE YO

### FOUR phases of ancient greek art!

#### GEOMETRIC

* simple design and composition
* hybrid animals (mythical composite figures)
* Orientalism
	* in art history, "oriental" refers to the Near East, not the Far East

#### ARCHAIC

* the most formative period in Greek art
* Archaic comes from "archaeos" which means "first" thus "archaeology" is the study of first-things
* got over orientalism and started doin' their own thing
* architecture hadn't gone Greek yet
	* still into frontality (inhereted from near east)
	* thick (crappy) local stone
	* not really balanced

#### CLASSICAL

#### HELLENISTIC

* they all ate at Helen's

### info

* stuff about gender politics:
	* fun fact: "gymnasium" comes from "gymnos" which means "naked"
	* revelling in athletic male nude form
	* greeks weren't so into women: "hysterical" comes from "hysterion" meant uterus.
	* they didn't have a word for homosexual, but it was pretty normal for dudes in school to get a lil crazy in the locker room, but were generally expected to get over it in their mid 20s
		* women were probs doing the same thing, but they didn't stuff down so we don't know for sure
			* except, of course, sappho
				* she was an excellent poet, taught poetry, and she wrote love poems for her students. She was from Lebsos, sooo…
* "barbus" meant beard (greeks all shaved); anyone who didn't speak greek spoke "barbar"
	* thus barbarians
* the only greek painting that survives is painted Vases, and a few etruscan tomb interiors
	* they also painted on leather, papyrus, and wood

### places

* basilica: temple of hera 1
	* ![basilica](http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/paestum-pictures/IMG_2207b.jpg)

	* wayyyy better than the basilica


### art
* **GEOMETRIC** krater
	* ![geometric krater](http://www.westcler.org/GH/curlessmatt/arthistory/4/GeometricVase.jpg)
	* they used it to hold their wine which they LITERALLY MIXED WITH OPIUM
		* AND STARTED DRINKING IT WHEN THEY WERE 3 YEARS OLD
			* WINE MIXED WITH OPIUM
				* WHICH KILLS YOU
					* but not as much as roman wine, which they sweetened with FUCKING LEAD
	* top row: dead guy on top of bier (fancy king bed) with lots of women lined up to stare at his corpse
		* you can tell they're women because their hands were on their hair; back in the day women mourned by ripping off their clothes and pulling their hair out
			* a bunch of the women were probably from the dude's family, but a bunch were probably *hired mourners*
	* bottom row: a bunch of army men with weird hourglass-shaped shields, SUPER-STYLIZED horses with way too many legs
		* funeral games: when someone important died the survivors liked to play a lot of sports. this is how the olympics started.
* Hero And Centaur
	* ![hero and centaur](http://www.proprofs.com/flashcards/upload/q8676443.jpg)
	* maybe herakles and nessos?
	* heroes were like old-school a$ap rocky / shaq / whomever
		* idolized and shit cuz they didn't have tv
	* they hadn't really figured out the whole centaur thing yet, so it was p much just a dude with a horse sticking out of his back (rather than a horse with a dude sticking out of his front)

	* another kouros
